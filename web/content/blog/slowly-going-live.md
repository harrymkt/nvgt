Hello everybody!
<!--more-->
We are pleased to announce that after over 2 years of development, the NVGT source code repository is about to go public for everyone to have a gander at!

The repository's state will switch to public within hours after this post, so keep an eye out!

Fun fact, the goal was to release this exactly 10 years (almost to the second!) since BGT became freeware on May 31st 2014 at 04:04:29 PM CDT.

Please keep in mind that this should be considered a release in progress. The repository is generally clean enough for public viewing and it is possible to use NVGT, but particularly for a few days after May 31st you should expect anything! from broken CI to failed builds to incomplete information. Documentation is still in progress and will take a while to complete. We will be actively working on preparing public releases and continuing for publicity even as this repository is published.

Until a much much more official public announcement is posted, please consider NVGT to be in a very bleeding edge state for the time being, there is still a lot of stuff we want to do before we are ready to actually advertise this engine. So just to be clear the engine is in a state where we are ready for public viewing from anybody curious of our progress and who wants to join the fun right away, but we have a ways to go before we would officially shout the engine's existance to the world and recommend that people learn it. At the time of writing you should consider this release to be in progress, not official or complete.

We recommend viewing the todo topic in the appendix section of the docs.

Have fun, and we hope you enjoy NVGT as well as watching us finish preparations!
