/**
	Returns the number of items in the array.
	1. uint array::length();
	2. uint array::size();
	## Returns:
		uint: the number of items in the array.
	## Remarks:
		This method returns the absolute number of elements in the array, that is, without taking 0-based indexing into account. For example an array containing {1, 2, 3} will have a length of 3, but you must access the last element with the index 2 and the first element with index 0, rather than using 3 for the last item and 1 for the first. This also means that you can access the last element with the shortcut `array.length() - 1`.

// Example:
void main() {
	int[] items;
	for (uint i = 0; i < random(1, 10); i++)
		items.insert_last(i);
	alert("The array contains", items.length() + " " + (items.length() == 1 ? "item" : "items"));
}
