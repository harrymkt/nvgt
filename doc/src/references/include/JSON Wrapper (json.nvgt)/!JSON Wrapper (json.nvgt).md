# JSON Wrapper (json.nvgt)
This is a class designed to read and write JSON configuration files.

## Notes:
- This include is a wrapper of the NVGT's builtin JSON ability to ease its management, from loading to saving using various ways including string and datastreams to minimize the workload of using builtin JSON parsing functions  and having to catch the errors manually.
