# Advanced topics for C++ developers
This section contains information that is useful for anyone who wishes to interact in any way with NVGT's source code. Whether someone wants to perform a simple sourcecode build, develop an NVGT plugin dll, learn how to contribute to the engine or just learn about how NVGT works internally, you will find such information here. The topics that will be discussed here will generally not be applicable for those who just want to develop games using NVGT using the installer downloaded from nvgt.gg.
